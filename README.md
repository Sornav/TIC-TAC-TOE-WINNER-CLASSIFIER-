Tic-Tac-Toe Winner classifier using Decision Trees and Random Forest on the tic-tac-toe-endgame data set,the dataset is availble on kaggle,we need to create a model that correctly classifies wether or not player X wins or not,firstly we used Decison Trees to Classify the winner and got a pretty good accuracy score,we further enhanced our model by using a Random Forest Classifier which performed a little bit better.
